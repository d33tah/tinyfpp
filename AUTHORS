Parts of the code (major) were taken from this tutorial:
http://nehe.gamedev.net/tutorial/loading_and_moving_through_a_3d_world/22003/

Credits:
Jeff Molofee (nehe@home.com) for writing the tutorials.
Alfred (alfred@mazuma.net.au) for various fixes and improvements.
Lakmal Gunasekara (gunasekara@prostep.de) for a Solaris/SPARC
	and SGI/IRIX port, which has improved the portability
	of the code base.  Also for tutorial 8, which I only
	tweaked slightly (basically uncommented what had been
	commented out for Solaris).
